# Snake Game - Java Project by Chi Phuc Nguyen

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Snake Game** built using **Java** and **Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The goal of the game is for the player to control a snake, eat apples to grow in size, and avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's body. As you collect apples, the speed of the snake increases to add more challenge.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats apples. The snake must avoid walls and its own body.
- **Adjustable Speed**: As the player collects apples, the snake's speed gradually increases.
- **Simple Lobby Screen**: A pre-game screen that provides the user with options to play or exit.
- **Graphical UI**: Smooth animations, responsive controls, and a visually engaging game board.
- **Responsive Controls**: Arrow keys to navigate the snake and control its movement.
- **Game Over Screen**: A screen appears when the player loses the game, with the option to exit.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 8 or Higher**: The core language used to implement the game logic and GUI.
- **Swing**: A part of Java's standard library, used to create the graphical interface, handle user input, and display the game screen.
